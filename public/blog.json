    "summary": "Hello Developers 👋🏻 Today let's learn about 'cookies' 🍪 What are Cookies? Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a user's device by websites they visit. These pieces of data contain information about the user's interactions and preferences on the site. 🌐 What are cookies on websites? Cookies on websites are essentially text files that store information about the user's browsing activity. When a user visits a website, the site sends a cookie to the user's browser, which is then stored on their device. 🔍 What are cookies used for? Cookies serve various purposes on websites, including remembering user preferences and settings, tracking user behavior for analytics and marketing, enabling features like shopping carts and user authentication, and personalizing content and ads based on user interests. 🔒 What is a third-party cookie? A third-party cookie is set by a domain other than the one the user is visiting, often used for tracking across websites, commonly by advertisers and analytics companies. 🛡️ How do cookies affect user privacy? Cookies can raise privacy concerns as they track user activity across sites. While some are necessary for functionality, others, particularly third-party cookies, are used for targeted ads without consent. Regulations like GDPR and CCPA protect user privacy by requiring websites to inform users and get consent for non-essential cookies. Know more about CCPA vs GDPR.
